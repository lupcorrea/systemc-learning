# Arithmetic Unit

## Brief Description and Credits

This is the source code used for developing a master-slave system. Once the program starts, one of the slaves is filled with 1000 integers, and, once this is done, the master transfers this data to another slave. This is done using solely SystemC data types and structures, with the spurpose to learn how communication works in SystemC. The experiment itself was based on an assignment for my H/S Design course, at the Federal University of Para√≠ba, in Brazil.

Please do notice that this experiment is based on the simple_bus example provided with the SystemC source code. I do not claim ownership of such files.

## How does it work?

## To Do Hitlist
* Write documentation about the project in here.
* Remove excessive files.

## General Stats
* As in version 1.0, approximately 2 hours were invested in total, including:
  * Research as to find out how SystemC communication worked in a master-slave system.
  * Coding
  * Debugging, to check compilation errors.
  * Checking if every output was all right.
