# Arithmetic Unit

## Brief Description and Credits

This is the source code used for developing a memory system. One of the slaves contains a character bank, based on ASCII. Another one has a randomly generated message that will be codified by a master, to be decodified again by another one, so that it finally reaches a third slave. This is done using solely SystemC data types and structures, with the main purpose to learn how an effective verification system should work in SystemC. The experiment itself was based on an assignment for my H/S Design course, at the Federal University of Para√≠ba, in Brazil.

Please do notice that this experiment is based on the simple_bus example provided with the SystemC source code. I do not claim ownership of such files.

Also notice that this isn't, in any ways, a hashing system. This was a mistake induced by end of semester exhaustion and stuff like that. I chose to leave the project named like this as a reminder to myself.

## How does it work?

## To Do Hitlist
* Write documentation about the project in here.
* Remove excessive files.

## General Stats
* As in version 0.6, approximately 4 hours were invested in total, including:
  * Designing the system's architecture
  * Designing the verification system
  * Designing the data flow
  * Coding
  * Debugging, to check compilation errors
  * Checking if every output was all right
