# SystemC Learning Projects

### Brief Description
I was bothered by the amount of repositories in my GitHub profile, so I decided to finally group the smaller ones in one super repository. This one has all the content I produced while I was learning SystemC for a H/S Design course in college.

### Contents
This repository contains four small projects:
* 2 bits adder
* Arithmetic unit
* Memory transfer manager
* Simple "Hashing"

Their descriptions can be obtained in their respective branches.
